Hi Ariel! It's great to hear you're reviewing all of those! I have way more pieces of advice to share than I will remember as I am replying to you, so I will likely just randomly dm you whenever I recall something I think is important. Some things right off the bat especially for the next day or two before the bootcamp gets underway: while things like bootstrap and jQuery are good to have an understanding of, it's always important to be mindful of the opportunity cost that comes with spending time on things that aren't as important to be strong with. I say that because I feel quite strongly about certain things being way more important than others to focus on. In particular, Bootstrap and jQuery are a waste of your time presently because they serve to improve upon things like CSS/vanilla JS, respectively. For instance, while you could quickly become comfortable with Bootstrap and create some pretty solid looking UIs, I would instead strongly advise you to focus on improving your understanding of vanilla CSS because it is extremely important to have even a very basic understanding of how to style DOM elements. Same goes for jQuery which only exists to make vanilla JS easier. If you ever were to use jQuery, instead just use Vanilla JS (see this resource (https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) which you dont have to understand, but it's better to have an understanding of how JS DOM manipulation works rather than jQuery). I am a big advocate for learning core concepts which will translate easily to any library.

HTML/CSS/VanillaJS/React are all great things to look into. The beginning of the program will be Vanilla JS, with React starting in your second week I believe. I would focus for now on Vanilla DOM manipulation instead of React, and then next weekend start looking into React (the react docs are an incredible learning resource).

Some random important (opinionated) pieces of advice:
- If there is one thing you learn at Codesmith, it should be learning how to learn new things as quickly as possible.
	- The most important aspect of this is that you need to **learn how to google**.
  	- See this video (https://youtu.be/cEBkvm0-rg0)
    	- This channel is an absolute GOLDMINE
      	- If you are looking for good coding content to binge on youtube, this is THE channel.
      	- I highly suggest you watch at least one of his videos whenever you are starting a new unit.
  	- At least have of my google searches for any coding question follow this simple formula:
    	- Name of the technology your question is relevant to
    	- The question you have
    	- site:stackoverflow.com
    	- Altogether a sample search would be "js how to check if an object is empty site:stackoverflow.com"
      	- follow this format and you will find answers to your questions faster than anyone else
	- Aside from googling, another tip in regards to how to find the answer to something:
  	- You will find that your cohort mates are constantly going back to the lecture slides to see how to do something.
			- I think of this as the easy way out of solving your problem.
			- The best thing you can do for yourself is GOOGLE EVERYTHING.
  			- The more you strengthen your ability to figure out any problem by googling, the better it will serve you when you need to google something that isn't in the slides which will naturally happen all the time.
- The best way to SO EASILY gradually advance to a coding level above the average Codesmith student is to make Leetcode.com/problemset/all your new home page
  - Codesmith has these things called "hackhours" which are great. most mornings you take 20 min to go over the problem from the previous hackhour, and then you have 40 min to solve an algorithm that you would likely see at a job interview.
    - While these are great, there are several issues I have with this.
      - Namely, these hackhours just aren't enough. It will serve you SO much better if you are steadily going through problems over the course of the program.
      - Secondly, one thing that the hackhours do not go over (sometimes they do, but it's rare) is the time complexity of an algorithm.
        - I would strongly recommend checking out some youtube videos on time complexity so that you can start being mindful of it earlier.
        - The most important thing is that for EVERY ALGORITHM YOU DO you should aim to be able to determine it's time and space complexity (time is way more important to have a strong understanding of)
  - The best thing you can do is when you wake up and are doing your morning routine e.g. making coffee or whatever, literally just pull up leetcode on your phone, and look at an easy or medium problem (ideally medium) and think about it while you go through your morning. Then at lunch or whenever, try and write up a solution. No luck? Great. DON'T SPEND MORE THAN 30 MINUTES ON A PROBLEM EVER EVER EVER. THIS IS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY COST COMES IN THE MOST. If you spend 1, 2 or even 3 hours trying to figure out some solution and then finally get it, that is time you could have spent on multiple other problems.
		- the moment where the learning happens is after you have already struggled through trying to find a solution, and you check the solution DEFINITELY in the "discuss" section of the problem, and optionally somewhere online. (if you dont mind the cost, leetcode premium is nice because it has guaranteed most optimal solutions with explanations + complexity explanations but it's by no means necessary since the "discuss" section is always a goldmine)
  		- Read through solutions and if you dont know what something is or why the solution did something, look it up and understand it. reading solutions to problems you have already struggled through will make your coding abilities improve at a rate that will beyond shock you + your cohort-mates.


I've gotta run now but will definitely be sharing more tips as they come to me. Please do not hesitate if you ever have a question on anything whether it's help with a problem approach, needing an explanation of some concept, or just to chat about the program. I will gladly take some time with you to help you understand whatever you find difficult to wrap your head around as well as walk you through my thought process for how I personally arrive at certain solutions or approaches.
